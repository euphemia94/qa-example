TEST PLAN FOR NEXITS TASK TABLE 
1. Title
Test Plan for Tasks Table Functionality and Performance Testing
2. Scope
2.1 In-Scope
* Functional testing of the Tasks table across all pages (1-10).
* Verifying CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* Testing filtering, sorting, pagination, and performance.
* Accessibility and responsiveness validation for the entire table.
2.2 Out-of-Scope
* Features or functionality outside the Tasks table.
* Backend system performance outside the table interaction.
3. Objective
To ensure the Tasks table delivers an optimal user experience by verifying key functionalities such as CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and pagination across pages 1-10. The aim is to identify and document any defects or performance issues, ensuring the application meets quality standards.
4. Key Functionality to be Tested
4.1 CRUD Operations
* Create, view, edit, and delete tasks across all pages.
* Validation for required fields during task creation and updates.
4.2 Filtering
* Applying filters by task attributes like status, priority, createdAt, etc.
* Verifying the accuracy of filter results across multiple columns.
4.3 Sorting
* Ensuring sorting works correctly by createdAt, priority, and other sortable columns.
* Testing ascending and descending sort orders.
4.4 Pagination
* Navigating between pages 1 to 10 and validating displayed data.
* Ensuring filters and sorting persist across pagination.
4.5 Performance
* Assessing load times for pages 1-10.
* Testing responsiveness during simultaneous user interactions.
4.6 Accessibility and Responsiveness
* Testing screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.
* Ensuring the table adjusts correctly on mobile devices.
5.0 Test Methodology
* Functional Testing: To verify the functionality of the Tasks table, including CRUD operations, sorting, filtering, and pagination.
* Boundary Testing: To test edge cases, such as the first and last page or invalid data inputs.
* Performance Testing: To measure page load time and API response times during CRUD operations and ensure responsiveness.
* Exploratory Testing: To uncover hidden issues by interacting with the table beyond predefined test scenarios.
6. Test Scenarios
6.1 CRUD Operations
1. Create a new task with valid data.
2. Attempt to create a task with missing required fields.
3. Edit an existing task and validate changes on reload.
4. Delete a task and ensure it no longer appears in the table.
5. Validate error messages for invalid inputs.
6.2 Filtering
1. Filter tasks by status and validate displayed results.
2. Apply a date range filter and verify results.
3. Combine multiple filters and check the outcome.
4. Test invalid filter inputs and ensure appropriate error handling.
6.3 Sorting
1. Sort the table by createdAt (ascending and descending).
2. Sort by priority and ensure stability with identical values.
3. Validate sorting consistency across paginated pages.
6.4 Pagination
1. Navigate to pages 2, 5, and 10 and verify data accuracy.
2. Validate item counts per page.
3. Combine pagination with filtering and sorting.
6.5 Performance
1. Measure the time taken to load pages.
2. Access responsiveness to changes made (eg create new task, update, delete etc).
5.6 Accessibility and Responsiveness
1. Validate keyboard navigation for CRUD operations.
2. Test responsiveness on developer console 
7. Edge Cases
1. Attempt to load a non-existent page (e.g., page 11).
2. Sort table with invalid date
3. Apply invalid format titles
4. Sort a column with identical values.
7.0 Duration One week (7 days)
Breakdown:
* Day 1–2: Familiarization with the system, defining test scenarios, and preparing test data.
* Day 3–5: Execution of functional, boundary, and performance test cases.
* Day 6: Documentation of bugs/issues and test evidence.
* Day 7: Report compilation, including recommendations and artifacts
Test Deliverables
The following deliverables will be submitted at the end of the testing cycle:
1. Test Plan Document.
2. Test Case Document.
3. Bug Report.
4. Test Summary Report.
