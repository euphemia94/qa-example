	Key Observations
* CRUD operations showed issues related to missing validation and table responsiveness post-operations.
* Filtering encountered functionality gaps when combining multiple filters and handling invalid input formats.
* Pagination lacked feedback for navigation to non-existent pages.
* Performance concerns arose as the table became unresponsive post-CRUD operations without a refresh.
